              <h1>What Will Our Game be?</h1>
              <br>
              <p class="fs-4">Our game, TurtleCove, will essentially be that of a play to earn MMOG featuring a wide variety of game modes. From <a href="">Dungeon crawler</a> to <a href="">Skirmish</a> and a lot more! Players will for the most part be able to login with their metamask wallets on the Polygon Network, to then access their in-game accounts. The vision of the game is to give players the opportunity to earn money that will be given out in $TRIBLING, our governace currency, while having fun with friends and randoms! It also provides more use cases for our coin $TRIBLING for better long term The vision of the game is to give players the opportunity to earn money that will be given out in $TRIBLING while having fun with friends and randoms!
                 It also provides more use cases for our coin $TRIBLING for better long term support.  <br> <br> Accessibility is a key feature in the game. It'll be made so all players of TurtleCove have the opportunity to, with a minimal investment, make up to 1 day ROIs. More information is provided as you scroll throughout this page on how this can be achieved.
                  Aside from that, TurtleCove will contain in game utilities that can be obtained through <a href=""> The Coral Reef </a> and the <a href="">Marketplace</a>. These gadgets can range from weapons and armor, to cosmetics, <a href="">souvenirs</a> and <a href="">boats</a>. These utilities however, don't necessarily provide competitive advantages in pvp, otherwise it would break the game. Instead it will bring forth greater potential rewards and more ways to earn from with the use of our <a href="">Ranking System.</a>
                   We wish to build a sustainable game around the topic of the endangered turtles and sea life in general to spread awareness and provide support.     </p>

                <h1>What is Needed to Get Access to TurtleCove?</h1>
                <br>
                <p class="fs-4">Essentially, all holders of TurtleTribe NFTs will have access to the MMOG play to earn game.
                   They will be able to play a bunhc of the game modes that we offer to start earning, typically paying an entrance fee that will vary between game modes and rankings.
                    Non TurtleTribe NFT holders will get access to a weekly play, where they will be able to win rewards without the cost of owning a TT NFT, or paying an entrance fee. This game mode however will only take place once a week.

                <h1>What will be used to develop TurtleCove?</h1>
                <br>
                <p class="fs-4">Unreal Engine 4 will be the game engine we use, along with the Etherlinker plugin which for the most part allows Unreal Engine to interact with solidity smart contracts. With this approach, we will have the ability to link the game to the Ethereum Blockchain.

                <br>
                <p class="fs-4">Dungeon crawler is one of the first pve game modes in TurtleCove in which players pay an entry fee of *amount* $TRIBLING to join. "..." </p>
              </div>
            </div>
            <div class="py-5">

                <br>
                <p class="fs-4">Similar to Dungeon crawlers, Players of the Skirmish pvp game mode are required to pay an entry fee of *amount* $TRIBLING before they are able to play. "..." </p>

                <br>
                <p class="fs-4">The Coral Reef, found in the warm tropical waters of TurtleCove, will shower in praise the fellow turtle who offers it Sea Shells which are obtained with $TRIBLING.
                   Rewards from the Coral Reef may vary from lost weapons to turtle <a href="">Souvenirs</a> to legendary lost treasures! </p>

                <h1>Marketplace</h1>
                <br>
                <p class="fs-4">Players will be able to buy utilities in the form of NFTs from the TurtleTribe marketplace. As mentioned before, these utilities can range from weapons and armors, to cosmetics, souvenirs and a lot more! These won't provide competitive advantages in pvp game modes,
                   but will open up new earning opportunities with the use of our <a href="">Ranking System</a>. The utilities, will for pve, provide a diversity of in game attributes and upgrades that will vary from one to the other, as well as reward bonuses which all depend on the <a href="">Rarity</a>.
                  Whats the difference between the marketplace and the coral reef? You'll be able to find the NFT you want, and have the option to buy it without risking getting a random NFT like in the coral reefs. That also means marketplace prices will be significantly higher than what it would
                cost at the coral reef for higher valued NFTs. Beware however, that the marketplace will not have an ifninite supply of everything. Meaning Players will also be able to sell their TurtleCove NFTs in the marketplace. </p>
              </div>

              <div class="offset-md-2">
                <h1>Ranking System</h1>
                <br>
                <p class="fs-4">TurtleCove's ranking system works in a way where every in game NFT utilities will yield a certain ranking score. Depending on your total ranking score, players will be put in certain leagues (bronze, silver, gold, etc..) which will identify what kind of matches they'll be able to join.
                   The higher the match's league, the higher the rewards earned by the players will be in pvp, with a slightly bigger entrance fee. Players of a higher ranking will still have the ability to go in matches of a lower ranking, but will earn what the rank of that match offers and pay its entrance fee.
                    For instance, if you are in the gold rank, you could play in the silver or bronze matches, while paying the entrance fee of the silver or bronze matches, and earn its rewards. Pvp gamemodes like <a href="">Ranked Play</a> and <a href="">Skirmish</a> will use this mechanism to keep the game from becoming a pay to win.  </p>
              </div>
            <div class="py-5">
              <div class="offset-md-2">
                <h1>Ranked Play</h1>
                <br>
                <p class="fs-4">Ranked play is a pvp game mode that uses the ranking system in which players can go in solos, duos or squads, and battle against others in a tournament based system of 3 rounds where the winners take 90% of the total entrance fee paid by all players, 5% will be burnt, 3% will go to devs and 2% will go to charity.</p>

                <h1>Weekly Play</h1>
                <br>
                <p class="fs-4">Weekly play will be our first pvp play to earn game that is free for anyone to enter, from TurtleTribe NFT holders to non NFT holders, and will have all players compete in a free for all.
                     All participants will then later be assigned a certain score from their placement, eliminations and other metrics. The higher the score, the higher the potential prize. Even players who obtain a low score will essentially receive rewards as well.   </p>

              <div class="offset-md-2">

                <br>
                <p class="fs-4">Souvenirs will give players pve bonuses and boosts to increase their likelihood of success! They can be attained through the marketplace, The Coral Reef, or potentially as an in game prize. Boats on the other hand will be used for other game modes and features still to come. More information on them will be given out at a later stage of the game. </p>

                <h1>Rarity</h1>
                <br>
                <p class="fs-4">TurtleCove NFTs will be distributed into different rarities, common, rare, unique and Legendary. The chamces for pulling NFTs of certain rarities will be as follows: <br>
                Common: 70% <br> Rare: 20% <br> Extravagant: 8% <br> Legendary: 2% <br> 
              The higher the rarity, the greater the ranking score. Meaning the more in game opporunities and rewards for pvp. For pve, Higher rarities will provide better boosts and bonuses. Last but not least, TurtleCove NFTs with a legendary rarity will allow players to join matches of a league lower than the one they are currently on for free, without paying any entrance fees and still earn rewards.  </p>
